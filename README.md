Abstract

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now raging throughout the world. To investigate the spread of the virus in the crowd, data analysis base on the case data provided by Hong Kong (HK) government is implemented in this paper. First, the raw data of HK COVID-19 cases are rearranged based on age, gender, and case classification. Then, age distribution and gender distribution of the HK cases are analysed with statistic charts. Further, the results are extended to the world with hypothesis testing and 95% confidence interval. Based on the results, it can be concluded that males are more likely to be infected by COVID-19 than females, and people at different ages actually vary little in the proportion of being infected. Besides, some suggestions are also proposed to the government. For example, more virus tests are currently necessary.
